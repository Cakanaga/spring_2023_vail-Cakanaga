# Getting Started

## Topics covered in today's module
* What is a GPU? 

GPU is a specialized processor that can peform a large number of computations efficiently so it is preferred when training a model using machine learning which ususally  requires a large dataset and many many computational operations

* Python base library basics
* [Numpy basics](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/numpy-cheat-sheet-data-analysis-in-python):

Array: A multi-dimensional array of homogeneous data types, such as integers or floating point numbers.

Shape: The dimensions of an array, represented as a tuple. For example, a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns would have a shape of (3, 4).

Axis: A dimension of an array. For example, in a 2D array, the first axis represents rows and the second axis represents columns.

* [Pandas basics](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/pandas-cheat-sheet-for-data-science-in-python):

Series: A one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type.

DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different data types.

Index: A labeled set of values that defines the row labels of a Series or DataFrame.

Missing data: Data that is not available or is not representable. Pandas provides various functions for handling missing data, such as filling missing values with a default value or dropping missing values.

Groupby: A process for splitting a DataFrame into groups based on one or more columns, and then applying a function to each group.

Merging: The process of combining two or more DataFrames based on a common column or index.

Concatenation: The process of joining two or more Series or DataFrames along an axis.

Pivot table: A two-dimensional data structure that summarizes data values by grouping data along one or more columns and aggregating data along another column.

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
Python libraries are more efficient than trying to do things in base python. 


## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Trying to understand how .loc[] works was hard at first. But through my reaserch I was able to find the error in the code.
