# Ethics and Bias

## Topics covered in today's module
* Data Ethics
* Feedback loops
* Bias

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

* When assessing models, it's important to consider not only quantitative metrics such as accuracy and precision, but also ethical metrics.
* The Ethical AI framework can be used to identify and evaluate additional ethical metrics.
* Examples of ethical metrics include fairness, which assesses whether the model is fair and unbiased towards all groups of people, and privacy, which evaluates whether the model respects the privacy of individuals whose data it processes.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment

Understanding bias in the context of AI can be challenging because the term can have different meanings depending on the context. In statistical terms, bias refers to a systematic difference between true parameters and the statistics used to estimate those parameters. In contrast, in the social science perspective of data ethics, bias refers to historical, measurement, aggregation, or representation issues that can arise in the data or algorithms used for AI. These types of bias can be complex and difficult to detect and mitigate, requiring a deep understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which the AI is being developed and used. Therefore, recognizing and addressing bias in AI requires ongoing research, education, and collaboration among experts in different fields.
